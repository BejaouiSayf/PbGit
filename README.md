# MatchItShiny

Keywords: *propensity score matching, multivariate matching, genetic optimization, causal inference, R.*

`MatchItShiny` is a Matching Software for Causal Inference.
Nonparametric Preprocessing for Parametric Casual Inference

The aim of `MatchItShiny` is to make the imputation of causal effect workflow easier. 

**1. Problematic**: There is no consensus on how exactly matching ought to be done and how to measure the success of the matching procedure. A wide variety of matching procedures have been proposed, and `MatchItShiny` implements many of them.


**2. 2sd problematic**: The work flow of an evaluateur 


**Fields**: each fields where you use method of causal inference - statistics (see for e.g Rubin 2006; Rosenbaum 2002), medecine (Christakis and Iwashyna 2003; Rubin 1997), economics  (Abadie and Imbens 2006; Dehejia and Wahba 2002, 1999), political science (Bowers and Hansen 2005; Herron and Wand 2007; Imai 2005), sociology (Morgan and Harding 2006; Diprete and Engelhardt 2004; Winship and Morgan 1999; Smith 1997) and even law (Rubin 2001).


`MatchItShiny` is an interactive application to visualise and perform impacts analysis. The interface is based on the Shiny web application framework, though can be run locally and with the user's own data.
